This repo contains homework assignments from my Computer Paradigms class. The goal of this class is to learn more about aspects of the design and implementation of functional, imperative and object-oriented programming languages, presented via a sequence of interpreters. Scheme will be used to practice these concepts.

## Homework Questions
The homework questions will come from Abelson and Sussman: The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs.

## Software
DrRacket will be the program of choice.
