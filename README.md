This repo contains our final project in Computer Paradigms class CSc 335 in the City College of New York taught by Professor Douglas Troeger.

## Introduction
This project contains an implementation of Lazy Pairing Heaps with Scheme and R5RS. The pairing heap will have its basic operations such as `make-heap`, `find-min`, `insert`, `merge`, and `delete-min` The algorithm was written by [Chris Panican](https://github.com/cpanican) and [Gerry Xu](https://github.com/gerryzqx).

## Software
[DrRacket](https://racket-lang.org/) will be the program of choice.

## Notes
The code on `streams.rkt` can be found on [Abelson and Sussman](https://web.mit.edu/alexmv/6.037/sicp.pdf), Section 3.5. Some of the functions in this file were used to accomplish our implementation of Lazy Pairing Heaps.
