This repo contains our final project in Computer Paradigms class.

## Introduction
This project contains an implementation of Lazy Pairing Heaps with Scheme and R5RS. The pairing heap will have its basic operations such as `make-heap`, `find-min`, `insert`, `merge`, and `delete-min` The algorithm was written by [Chris Panican](https://github.com/cpanican) and [Gerry Xu](https://github.com/gerryzqx).

## Software
DrRacket will be the program of choice.
